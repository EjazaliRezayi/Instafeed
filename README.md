Instafeed is a website built as a course project, which utilizes mostly React as the front-end and Firebase as the back-end. It's a customizable and curated Instagram client, one that lets you follow a user, post a picture while also commenting on it. The website combines everything that we love about Instagram<sup>TM</sup> whilst making it better!
